# Bridging the gap between high school and university

The transition from high school to university is BIG because:
1. The Learning Pace is Faster
    - expect covering multiple chapter/section per class
    - recommendation: 
        - try pre-reading before every class just to familiarize yourself with the content. It could be a brief skeleton overview to help you know what to expect before a class.
2. The Workload is Heavier
    - very cliche but also very true. 
    - recommendation: 
        - organization is key. Use a calendar, agenda, or any other software that serves this role. You want to keep track of all your deadlines.
        - prioritization is key. Understand what is ***important/not important*** and ***urgent/not urgent***. Many tasks and deadlines can be categorized as a combination of these two. This will help you understand how to optimize your effort and what should be on the agenda.   
        - planning is key. Always set a stretch goal before your study session. Don't blindly burn through a couple hours of studying only to forget the purpose of why you are studying.
3. The Assessments are Harder
    - There is more focus on application and theory 
    - recommendation:
        - Always challenge yourself
            - No: rewriting notes, looking at solutions, solving problems that you are already fluent in 
            - Yes: solving a variety of problems, going through practice exams, helping others 

> Obviously this isn't a comprehensive list but it is a good starting point
